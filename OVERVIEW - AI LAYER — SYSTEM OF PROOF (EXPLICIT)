AI LAYER — SYSTEM OF PROOF (EXPLICIT)
HARD RULE (IMPORTANT)

AI never edits truth.
AI never overrides humans.
AI never mutates evidence.

AI only:

Analyzes evidence

Predicts risk

Flags anomalies

Assists audits

All AI outputs are annotated, explainable, and logged.

WHERE AI LIVES IN THE SYSTEM
1. AI RISK ENGINE (CORE SERVICE)

Service

/services/ai-risk-engine


Consumes

Evidence Nodes

Immutable Event Ledger

Historical incidents

Near-misses

Certification lapses

Field logs

Authority violations

Produces

Risk scores

Predictive flags

Clusters

Alerts

AI OUTPUTS ARE EVIDENCE-LINKED, NOT EVIDENCE

2. SAFETY & NEAR-MISS AI (MODULE A)
A. Near-Miss Clustering AI

Uses

Text from observations

Location patterns

Time-of-day

Weather

Crew overlap

Outputs

“These 3 sites are converging toward an incident”

“This hazard pattern repeats every 14 days”

Stored As

ai_insights
- id
- insight_type (near_miss_cluster)
- confidence_score
- supporting_evidence_ids[]
- generated_at


Linked To

Safety dashboards

Audit Defense (read-only)

Risk trend reports

3. JHA AI ASSIST (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
AI-Assisted Hazard Suggestions

When

Creating a JHA

AI Suggests

Missing hazards

Common mitigations

Historical incident overlaps

User Must Confirm
AI suggestions are not applied automatically.

Logged As

ai_suggestions
- suggestion_type (jha_hazard)
- accepted (true/false)

4. CERTIFICATION & FATIGUE AI (MODULE D)
A. Certification Lapse Risk AI

Predicts

Likelihood of expired cert causing work interruption

Exposure severity if ignored

Feeds

Certification Enforcement Engine

Insurance Exposure Modeling

B. Fatigue Risk Modeling

Uses

Field logs

Hours-of-service

Incident correlation

Outputs

Fatigue risk score (non-payroll)

Supervisor alerts before violations

This is huge liability protection.

5. INCIDENT & EMERGENCY AI (MODULE B)
A. Incident Escalation Prediction

Uses

Incident type

Location

Hazmat proximity

Historical analogs

Outputs

“This incident has 78% probability of regulatory escalation”

“Recommend drug/alcohol trigger now”

AI does not trigger actions — it recommends.

B. Cost Overrun Prediction

Uses

Past claims

Labor/equipment usage

Vendor performance

Outputs

Early warning for finance & insurance teams

6. AUDIT & LEGAL AI (MODULE F)
A. Audit Readiness Scoring

Outputs

Audit completeness %

Missing evidence flags

Weak documentation warnings

Auditors love this because it reduces audit time.

B. Legal Defense Timeline AI

Generates

Chronological narrative from evidence

Highlighted risk points

Gaps in proof

Output is a draft, not a filing.

7. REGULATOR TRANSPARENCY AI (LIMITED)

AI is NOT exposed to regulators directly.

However:

AI can pre-check regulator views

Flag what regulators will likely question

This avoids surprises.

AI DATA MODELS (ADDED)
model AIInsight {
  id              String   @id @default(uuid())
  insightType     AIInsightType
  confidenceScore Float
  generatedAt     DateTime @default(now())
}

enum AIInsightType {
  near_miss_cluster
  fatigue_risk
  certification_exposure
  incident_escalation
  audit_gap
}

model AISuggestion {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  suggestionType String
  accepted    Boolean?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}

AI GOVERNANCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every AI output is:

Logged

Traceable

Explainable

No black-box decisions

No automated enforcement

Humans remain accountable

This is regulator-safe AI.



This is the correct way to do AI in rail, construction, and emergency systems.
